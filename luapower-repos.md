tagline: the luapower multigit meta-package
---

This multigit repo is the luapower's meta-package. It contains the `.origin`
files of all the official luapower packages which enables `mgit clone-all`,
`mgit ls-all` and `./lp ls-all`.

It also contains various luapower-specific mgit plugins useful for building
packages and working with git (type `mgit` in the luapower dir for info on
those) and `luapower-cat.md` which enables the [luapower] module to
categorize packages for the website.
